<p>Saharsa is a city located in the eastern part of Bihar, India, serving as the administrative headquarters of Saharsa district and the Kosi Division.
Positioned just east of the Kosi River, the city lies within the fertile yet flood-prone Kosi river basin, often referred to as the "Sorrow of Bihar" due 
to its frequent and devastating floods.Established as a district on April 1, 1954, Saharsa has deep roots in the Mithila region, a significant center of 
ancient Brahminical civilization. The village of Mahishi is notable for the legendary philosophical debate between Adi Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra. 
The region's flat terrain and fertile soil make it ideal for agriculture, but the area is highly susceptible to flooding due to the Kosi River's shifting course. 
Saharsa is a significant rail hub in Bihar, with Saharsa Junction connecting the city to major destinations like Patna, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai. The tourist places 
saharsa are Shri Ugratara Temple ,Sun Temple,Chandikasthan,Rakta Kali Mandir,Matsyagandha Lake etc.</p>
